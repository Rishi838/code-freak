You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps



class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
       vector<int> dp;
         dp.push_back(0);
         dp.push_back(1); dp.push_back(2);
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++)
            dp.push_back(dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]);
        return dp[n];
    }
};
