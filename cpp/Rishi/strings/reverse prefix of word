Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the 
character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".





class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string s, char ch) {
        int i=0;
        while(i<s.size() && s[i]!=ch)
            i++;
        if(i==s.size())
            return s;
        for(int j=0;j<=i/2;j++)
        {
            swap(s[j],s[i-j]);
        }
        return s;
    }
};
